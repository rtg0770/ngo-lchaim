      <mat-card-content>
        In 2011 Yael Schoultz started visiting women in prostitution in the
        brothels of Prague, Czech Republic, building friendships, and developing
        the vision to see a team trained and equipped to provide care and
        services to women in prostitution. Slowly this team formed, and in 2014
        a two year certificate training programme was established to further
        educate and equip team members to be more effective in their care for
        women in prostitution. In 2018 the service to women in prostitution was
        expanded to include not only Prague but also the second largest city of
        the Czech Republic which is named Brno.
